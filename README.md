The downloaded EPUB files will be saved in the `epub` folder in the current directory.

### Graphical User Interface

```

2. (Optional) Change the output directory using the "Browse" button
3. Click "Download" to start the download

## Finding Book IDs

Book IDs can be found in the URL of the Kakuyomu novels. For example, in the URL:
[物語の黒幕に転生して～進化する魔剣とゲーム知識ですべてをねじ伏せる～（Web 版）`](https://kakuyomu.jp/works/16816700427572694145)

The book ID is `16816700427572694145`.

## Example

```
python kakuyomu.py install 16816700427572694145
```

Or using the GUI, just enter `16816700427572694145` in the Book ID field and click "Download".

## Troubleshooting
